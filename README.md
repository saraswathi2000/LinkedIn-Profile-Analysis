LinkedIn Profile Data Analysis

To start off with this project we have to get a dataset of our own activities on LinkedIn. This is possible with LinkedIn's option for downloading our personal data in an archived format. The steps are:-

Go to Settings & Privacy
Select Data Privacy Tab
Click on "Get a Copy of your Data" option
Download the options with respect to your choice and click on request
Our data will be ready as a downloadable Zip file within 24 Hours
The analysis of the profile is done with the help of Microsoft Excel and Microsoft Power BI Desktop. Data quality is checked and cleaned for duplicate or null values using Excel and then it is loaded into Power BI. The important metrics for a LinkedIn profile analysis are Connections, Messages and Companies Followed. Hence those are created using calculated measures and used in the visualizations.
